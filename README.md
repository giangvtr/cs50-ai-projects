# CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python â€“ Project Repository
__**Status** : Ongoing__

Welcome to my project repository for **CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python** (CS50AI), offered by Harvard University and taught by Brian Yu. This repository showcases my work, implementations, and learning progress throughout the course.

## About the Course

CS50AI explores the foundational concepts behind artificial intelligence, including:

0. Search algorithms:
   * Depth-first-search (DFS), Breath-first-search (BFS), Greedy Best-First Search, A* Search
   * Adversarial Search: Minimax, Alpha-Beta Prunning, Depth-Lmited Minimax
1. Knowledge representation and logical inference:
   * Propositional Logic and First Order Logic
   * Inference: rules and resolutions
   * Knowledge Engineering
2. Uncertainty and probabilistic reasoning
3. Optimization
4. Machine learning (supervised and reinforcement)
5. Neural Networks
6. Natural language processing

## Files system
* `0-1_degrees` : A graph-based search algorithm to identify the shortest path of connections between two actors using a dataset of movies and people
* `0-2_tictactoe` : An AI bot to beat you in tic-tac-toe using minimax algorithm
* `1-1_knights` : A logical inference AI to solve the Knights and Knaves puzzle by modeling knowledge and applying propositional logic.
* `1-2_minesweeper`: Solve your minesweeper game base using logic inference
* `2-1_pagerank`:

## How to prepare the environment
* To activate the env: ```source .../cs50_ai_env/bin/activate```
* In CLion : Go to Settings > Project > Add existing interpreter
* Browse the right python file in one of the venv created > bin
---
## Notes
* All projects are implemented individually as part of the CS50AI coursework.
* Some projects include starter code provided by the course; the core logic (especially AI algorithms) is implemented by me.
